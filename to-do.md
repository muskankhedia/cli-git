1. Check if the input is a URL - Done
2. Check if that URL already exists, if yes, don't add it again
3. Aware the user about the exit command on every prompt
4. Refine the code
5. Implementation of forward and backward arrow key for issues and PR
6. Delete or List the repos name/url link, based on different flags
7. Command to extract(init) with all the github repos of the user
